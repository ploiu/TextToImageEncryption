# TextToImageEncryption
Encrypts text to an image using a password you provide, and can decrypt that image back to the original text

This was a project I did in highschool, but it didn't fully work. I don't have the original source anymore so I figured I'd rewrite it to actually work in a new language I'm learning - Kotlin.
